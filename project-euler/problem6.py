Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the
first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 

3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
